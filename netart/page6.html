<h1>how could it get any worse</h1>
<p>well...</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>the year that came after my grandmother's death was possibly the worst year of my life</p>
<p>like for real...hard as fuck</p>
<p>i had to move out of the only home i ever knew 7 months later</p>
<p>and i bounced around a lot</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>i had roommates steal from me</p>
<p>money, clothes, shoelaces</p>
<p>i didn't trust a lot of people then</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>i checked myself into the er a few times</p>
<p>the gaps between self harm and attempts to end my life were closing in</p>
<p>i totaled my car</p>
<p>i was broke, depressed, <b>grieving</b></p>
<p>and worst of all i felt so alone</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>"it feels like walking through a dense forest in thick fog</p>
<p>it scares me</p>
<p>in years prior, there was safety</p>
<p>i had time and a place to catch my breath</p>
<p>it would feel like the fog would clear and I could see the next steps</p>
<p>there was home</p>
<p>this is the first time in my life there is no safety net</p>
<p>there is no back up plan, there is no place that feels like home</p>
<p>i'm tired of feeling lost</p>
<p>the fog hasn't cleared in a while and sometimes i'm scared it never will"</p>

<br></br>
<p>"i'm exhausted and i don't know if it's possible to keep pushing forward</p>
<p>it feels too dark to see the light, like there is no light</p>
<p>like there's no way out"</p>

<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>i felt so lost and hopeless</p>
<p>and i just kept pushing because that's all we can do sometimes</p>
<p>but fuck, were there days i really didn't want to</p>
<p>this went on until late 2019</p>
<p>riding the line between pushing forward and giving up</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>and then on my 26th birthday i visited a friend</p>
<p>at the bar he tends</p>
<p>and i didn't know it then</p>
<p>but that night changed everything</p>
