<h1>how did this all become ok</h1>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>obviously this is the abridged story over the course of almost 5 years</p>
<p>the point though is that it's not always ok</p>
<p>some days pull me back into the dark</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>"i dreamt of you last night again</p>
<p>it was only for a few precious seconds</p>
<p>you sat with me at out favorite park</p>
<p>and just talked with me</p>
<p>you said 'i'll be gone by the fall'</p>
<p>and i told you not to say things like that</p>
<p>and i hugged you close</p>
<p>and kissed your cheek</p>
<p>i wish i would have known this then</p>
<p>maybe i would have been more prepared to lose you</p>
<p>i wish we could go back to the lake</p>
<p>i miss you so much and it never gets easier"</p>

<p>but grief has taught me something</p>
<p>big or small, loss happens</p>
<p>it comes in different ways</p>
<p>the small ones may get easier, the big ones never do</p>
<p>but your capacity grows to hold that grief</p>
<p>it changes us</p>
<p>and if we allow it</p>
<p>we become who we were meant to be</p>
