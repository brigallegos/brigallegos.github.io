<h1>what happens when the fog lifts</h1>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>my 26th birthday was going to be extremely depressing that year</p>
<p>i thought about joining the 27 club a year early, joking...kinda</p>
<p>i had no plans, no money and not a lot of friends</p>
<p>so i did what any self respecting 20 something year old would do on their birthday</p>
<p><b>i went to a bar and drank alone</b></p>
<p>but only kind of alone</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>my best friend was working</p>
<p>honestly i had kind of neglected the friendship because i was severely depressed</p>
<p>and kind of incapable of the upkeep of friendships at the time</p>
<p>but here's the thing i love about this man</p>
<p>regardless how long we go without seeing each other or hanging out</p>
<p>he will always come to me with the warmest welcomes and the biggest hugs</p>
<p>i don't think he knows it</p>
<p>but he kind of saved my life that night</p>
<p>because i really wanted to do something stupid and final</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>so fast forward a few weeks after becoming a regular at this bar</p>
<p>i started working there</p>
<p>i meet some more of the best humans i've ever met</p>
<p>and something happened</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>the fog started lifting</p>
<p>and not just lifting, but like vaporizing</p>
<p>not just because i had a fun new job</p>
<p>or that i wasn't struggling financially</p>
<p>but i had found my people</p>
<p>and i started to actually like myself</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>it was safe to be me</p>
<br></br>
