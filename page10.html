<h1>wow!! you made it</h1>
<p>(holy shit i didn't think we would get this far)</p>
<p>uh well, this is the end!!</p>
<p>or is it the beginning?</p>
<p>this feels like an end to a chapter</p>
<p>and the beginning of something else...</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>but what happens if i forget?</p>
<p>what happens if i forget their voice or their touch?</p>
<p>how do i forgive myself for that?</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p><b>it is impossible</b></p>
<p>to forget them is to admit to never truly loving them</p>
<p>and you know that isn't true</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>it's ok to be happy again</p>
<p>it's ok to enjoy your life</p>
<p>you are not required to only remember the sad or bad parts</p>
<p>you are not required to always live life in pain</p>
<p>and you owe it to yourself to live everyday remembering that</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>you can not escape grief</p>
<p>i will greet it like an old friend</p>
<p>having known it is not the end, but something is on the horizon</p>
<p>something worth experiencing loss</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>love you bud, you got this<3</p>
