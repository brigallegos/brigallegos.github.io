<h1>this is the end</h1>
<p>or is it the beginning?</p>
<p>this feels like an end to a chapter,</p>
<p>and the beginning of another...</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>but what happens if i forget?</p>
<p>what happens if i forget their voice or their touch?</p>
<p>how do i forgive myself for that?</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p><b>it is impossible</b></p>
<p>to forget them is to admit to never truly loving them</p>
<p>and you know that isn't true</p>
<br></br>
<p>it's ok to be happy again</p>
<p>it's ok to enjoy your life</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>you are not required to only remember the sad or bad parts</p>
<p>you are not required to always live life in pain</p>
<p>and you owe it to yourself to live everyday remembering that</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>love u, ur doing great<3</p>
