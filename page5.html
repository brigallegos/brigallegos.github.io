<h1>losing her...</h1>
<br></br>
<p>summer 2017 right after leaving a shitty job</p>
<p>my life fell apart</p>
<p>my family tore apart because of me</p>
<p>majors mistakes were made</p>
<p>things some believe are unforgivable</p>
<p>trust was shattered</p>
<p>and i ultimately wanted to end my life</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>my grandmother was the rock in our family</p>
<p>when she got really sick, i committed all of my time to her care</p>
<p>i would have done it regardless of the turmoil i had created</p>
<p><b>but this was my only way to make things right to her</b></p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>so from the end of july, i stayed home</p>
<p>i prepared her meals and medications</p>
<p>i took her to all of her doctor visits</p>
<p>i took over all the household accounts and financial needs</p>
<p>i spent all my time with her</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>the routines, the hours of watching game shows, the sneaking of mcdonald's french fries</p>
<p>i think these were some of her best days</p>
<p>she wasn't always feeling the best or the strongest, but she was taken care of</p>
<p>she had someone to talk to and laugh with</p>
<p>who didn't make taking care of her feel like a burden</p>
<p>those are the days i miss the most</p>
<p>i miss her stories, her voice, her laugh</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>i wasn't ready for december 3rd 2017</p>
<p>she passed as i held her hand waiting for emt's to arrive</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>that morning, she remarked "what a beautiful day it is"</p>
<p>my dad says "i think she knew she was leaving us"</p>
<p>"that she was going to meet jesus"</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>i don't believe in god</p>
<p>but man, do i hope there's a heaven</p>
<p>because i know she'd be there</p>
<br></br>
