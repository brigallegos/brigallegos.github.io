<h1>the nightmare that is late stage capitalism</h1>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>the bay is grossly expensive</p>
<p>and its impossible to live alone working for minimum wage</p>
<p>so when i took this job managing a coffee shop</p>
<p>i thought i was doing what was right for myself financially</p>
<br></br>
<p>what i didn't know was how convoluted the franchise was</p>
<p>and how this job would drain the will to live out of me</p>
<p><b>70 hour weeks, unpaid overtime, and being paid nearly $$15k less than</p>
<p>what other companies were starting their managers at took a huge toll on me</b></p>
<p>and after a year in the company, this was the first time i felt i hit rock bottom</p>
<p>my depression and anxiety got unmanageable</p>
<p>i was abusing drugs and alcohol to cope with how low i felt</p>
<p>because i had no clue how to help myself and no resources to do so</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p><b>shit gets hard when you feel you have no where to turn, and no one to turn to</b></p>
<p>i left that job only because things at home were deteriorating in my family</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p><b>this is where the grief begin</b></p>
