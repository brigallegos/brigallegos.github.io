<h1>there was a new era being birthed</h1>
<p>a better me was on the horizon</p>
<p>and with a new you comes the loss of what no longer serves you</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>by no means was this new season easy</p>
<p>and we were entering a global pandemic</p>
<p>it's like the world has been grieving for two years straight</p>
<p>but while it felt like the world was being set on fire</p>
<p>i started this change</p>
<p>i had began shedding the old me</p>
<p>and i began to grieve the girl i once was</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>at first i was in denial</p>
<p>that i was always this "new version" of me</p>
<p>and i was finally debuting her to the world</p>
<br></br>
<p>and then i was angry</p>
<p>at her stupidity, her inability to speak up for herself, at the way she people pleased</p>
<p>at the way she would so willing give all of herself to people who did not deserve it</p>
<br></br>
<p>i attempted for a while to keep her alive</p>
<p>trying to bargain for the pieces of her i missed</p>
<br></br>
<p>i was depressed when i realized she could no longer exist</p>
<p>sorry for her, that she deserved so much better and it wasn't granted to her</p>
<br></br>
<p>and finally i accepted her with loving arms</p>
<p>laying her to rest</p>
<p>i was going to do better for her</p>
